# Fresh

#### The opposite of [Stale](https://github.com/apps/stale). A bot against stale bots.

This GitHub OAtuh app will leave a comment in your name whenever a stale bot is about to close an issue you're subscribed to. _Let the fight begin._

## Why?

Issues don't go away just because you don't look. Many projects maintain a facade of good health by ignoring and auto-closing issues. Closed issues discourage outside contribution. It is often unclear whether an issue is still present. And so on. This scenario is a nightmare for developers.

## How?

The app watches notifications and acts when a bot comments a stale warning, usualy starting with "`This issue has been automatically marked as stale`".

## Conventions

This project follows [C-Hive guides](https://github.com/c-hive/guides) for code style, way of working and other development concerns.

## License

The project is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
