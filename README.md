# Yes, my issue is important

#### A bot against stale bots.

This GitHub OAtuh app will leave a comment in your name whenever a [stale bot](https://github.com/marketplace/stale) is about to close an issue you're subscribed to. _Let the fight begin._

## Why?

Issues don't go away just because you don't look. Many projects maintain a facade of good health by ignoring and auto-closing issues. Closed issues discourage outside contribution. It is often unclear whether an issue is still present without reading through the whole thread. And so on. This scenario is a nightmare for developers. A reasonable alternative would be using tags for issues that don't warrant the internal developer(s) attention.

## How?

The app watches notifications and acts when a bot comments a stale warning, usualy starting with "`This issue has been automatically marked as stale`".
